# FrontEnd-Practice-Projects
This repository is a comprehensive collection of projects that highlights my journey to becoming a full-stack developer. The projects showcased in this repository demonstrate my proficiency in 
utilizing HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to create visually appealing and interactive web applications.

Each project in this repository represents a milestone in my learning process, showcasing my grasp of front-end development concepts and techniques. From responsive website designs to dynamic 
user interfaces, these projects demonstrate my ability to leverage HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create engaging user experiences.

Additionally, the integration of Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework, further enhances the projects by providing a robust and mobile-friendly foundation. By organizing these projects in 
one repository, I aim to provide a comprehensive overview of my front-end development skills and showcase my ability to create visually appealing, interactive, and responsive user interfaces. 
Each project includes well-structured HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

Please note that this repository is a continuous work in progress, as I strive to expand my knowledge and skills in front-end development. I will continue to update this repository with new 
projects, incorporating the latest front-end technologies and best practices.

# 1.Bookmark Website
The Bookmark Website project is a practice exercise that demonstrates basic CRUD operations and URL validation using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and local storage. The website allows users to add 
bookmarks through a form, which are then saved locally. Users can export the bookmarks, display them on the website, and delete them as needed. The project also includes URL validation to 
ensure valid entries. Each bookmark has a button that allows users to navigate directly to the saved URL. This project serves as an opportunity to practice front-end development skills and 
gain experience in handling user input, data storage, and dynamic rendering. Feel free to explore the project and interact with the bookmarking functionality.

# 2.Smart Login System
The Smart Login System is a web-based project that enables users to sign up, log in, and access personalized content through a secure authentication process.

# Features
1. Signup Page: Users can register by providing their name, email, and password. The input is validated using regular expressions to ensure data accuracy. Valid user information is stored in the local storage for future logins.

2. Login Page: Users can enter their email and password to access their accounts. The system verifies the credentials against the stored user information. Successful login redirects users to the home page, while incorrect credentials trigger an error message.

3. Home Page: Authenticated users are greeted with a personalized welcome message on the home page, which retrieves their name from the local storage. The page can be customized to display user-specific content, enhancing the user experience. A logout button is provided to securely log out users, clearing their authentication credentials.
